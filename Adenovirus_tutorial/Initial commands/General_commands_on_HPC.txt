
# Here are a few commands we will be using to play around with our data and make sure the files are how we want them

# 1. Starting an interactive session in putty

#  sinteractive allocates computer resources to you so you can run a few things on the HPC yourself instead of using job scripts and running sbatch
# -p stands for what partition (type of computer process we want to run) in this case we use io which is the download node on the HPC. This is how we can download and upload files off websites or other servers. 
# -c is the number of CPUs we require. 1 will be plenty
# -m is the amount of memory we require. 500 megabytes will be plenty
# -A is to specify your 02D account number. Remember to change this! You can look yours up with get_project_codes
sinteractive -p io -c 1 -m 500M -A OD-123456

# We want to download all the data we need for this workship. 
# The data is stored on github so we need to download it from github 
# first let's navigate to your scratch1 working directory

cd $SCRATCH1DIR

# Now we can download the files we need with

git pull
